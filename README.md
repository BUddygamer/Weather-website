# Weather-website
I've completed a project on a weather website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any location worldwide. HTML forms the structural backbone of the site, creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their desired location. CSS enhances the visual appeal, ensuring a clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices.

JavaScript is the core technology powering the dynamic functionality of the website. It fetches weather data from a public API, processes the information, and displays it on the website in a user-friendly format. Users can view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions, along with a five-day forecast. The site also features error handling to manage invalid inputs or connectivity issues gracefully.

Additionally, I implemented geolocation functionality to automatically detect and display the weather for the user's current location upon visiting the site. The project not only demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development but also showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs and handle asynchronous operations efficiently. This weather website project reflects a blend of aesthetic design and functional robustness, aimed at delivering a seamless user experience.
